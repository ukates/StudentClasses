STUDENT CLASSES

The purpose of this code is to practice OOP with Java.
This program uses a class called CollegeStudent as well as a test class called TestStudentClass with the main method.

The application will prompt the user for student information with JOPtionPane and utilize that information to create 
an instance of the CollegeStudent class. It will take the information from two students and create two instances and 
display that information in two seperate dialog boxes that calculate the expected graduation date which is exactly 4
years after the enrollment date.
